**In-Class Exercise: Exploring ggplot2 with the diamonds Dataset**

**Objective:**

Apply what youâ€™ve learned about ggplot2 to explore and visualize the diamonds dataset. This exercise will help you practice mapping aesthetics, customizing plots, and using facets to uncover trends in the data.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Explore the Data**

Explore the "diamonds" dataset.

Take note of key variables such as carat, price, cut, and color.

**Tasks**

**Task 1: Scatter Plot**

Create a scatter plot with the following requirements:

-   **x-axis:** carat (weight of the diamond).

-   **y-axis:** price (price of the diamond).

-   Map the color of the points to clarity (diamond clarity).

-   Add a trend line using geom_smooth() with se = FALSE (hide confidence intervals).

-   Customize the title and axis labels using labs().

**Answer**

-   

```{r setup}
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Examine the structure and summary of the dataset.
str(diamonds)  # Check the structure of the dataset
summary(diamonds)  # View summary statistics
head(diamonds)  # Preview the first few rows of the dataset

# Create a scatter plot with carat on the x-axis, price on the y-axis, and color mapped to clarity.
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = clarity)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +  # Add a trend line without confidence intervals
  labs(
    title = "Diamond Prices by Carat and Clarity",
    x = "Carat (Weight)",
    y = "Price (USD)",
    color = "Clarity"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Task 2: Faceted Plot**

Use facets to compare the relationship between carat and price across different diamond cut categories:

-   Use facet_wrap() to create subplots for each cut.

-   Arrange the facets in 2 rows.

-   Apply the theme_classic() theme to the plot for a clean appearance.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~ cut, nrow = 2) +  # Create subplots for each cut with 2 rows
  labs(
    title = "Faceted Plot: Carat vs. Price by Cut",
    x = "Carat (Weight)",
    y = "Price (USD)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()  # Apply a minimal theme
```

**Task 3: Bonus Challenge**

-   Use the coord_cartesian() function to zoom into the data for diamonds with carat between 0 and 3.

-   Add annotations to highlight trends in one of the cut categories (e.g., the cut with the highest-priced diamonds).

-   Customize the color palette using scale_color_brewer().

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 3)) +  # Zoom into the carat range 0 to 3
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +  # Use a custom color palette
  labs(
    title = "Diamond Prices for Carats 0-3 by Cut",
    x = "Carat (Weight)",
    y = "Price (USD)",
    color = "Cut"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
